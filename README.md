## Overview

One of the biggest challenges facing education today is the lack of engagement and motivation among students. This problem is compounded by the fact that students are often bogged down by a huge amount of material that they need to study, making it difficult to stay focused and motivated. With the rise of technology, there is now a great opportunity to create a learning app that addresses these challenges and makes learning more engaging and effective.

The e-learning app aims to provide users with an interactive platform for learning various subjects and skills through online courses. The app will cater to users of all age groups, from students to working professionals, who are looking to expand their knowledge base and improve their skills.
